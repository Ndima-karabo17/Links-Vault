## Links Vault

It is a professional grade Link management Dashboaard designed for users who need a centralized, aesthetic, and secure place to store their most important web connections.

The aim of the project
-
It is to move away from cluttered browser bookmarks and into a dedicated workspace that feels like a modern product.

Core System Architecture
-
The application is built as a single page website. Instead of the browser reloading every time you click a button or a link, I used React Router to swap the components instantly for a "app-like" experience.

About colors used in my project
-
I picked baby blue and white theme to project <strong>trust, clarity and productivity</strong>

I didn't use images in the Auth and Dashboard sections because the user experience is focused entirely on the data.

The Link View page uses CSS Grid system that will automatically calculates how many columns can fit on your screen, to make it look perfect.

Functional Breakdown of my site
-

1. The Entry(Landing Page): It have sections that introduces auth pages.It tells you more about the site and who created it.
2. The Vault(Add Link): A structure from that captures not just a URL, but context, (Title/description/Tags) of why that link matters..
3. The Library(Link View): A persistent gallery of users connections. It shows data from local storage allow a user to delete, read, and edit.
